# Jekyll-Sass-Bundler Template

This is just a starting point for creating static sites with Jekyll and Sass. I included Bundler for
simple package management.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to whatever directory you want.

    `git clone `git://github.com/haydenk/jekyll-sass-bundler-template.git your-site`


2. Run `bundle install` inside the site directory.


3. `foreman start` and go to http://localhost:9292 and start developing your static site.



### Switching Remotes

Unless you are planning on on contributing back to this project, you will want to delete
the remote to this project and add your own.


1. Delete remote. - `git remote remove origin`


2. Add your own remote. - `git remote add <your git url>`
